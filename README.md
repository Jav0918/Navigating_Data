# Navigating_Data 

This is a simple demonstration of using data structures and algorithms to navigate date. We have a 2D array initialized with states and capitals. This program will take user input and search for a capital. If the capital was found it will return a prompt advising them that the capital is indeed a US state capital, otherwise it is not. The program will then print the states and capitals to console, and we will then sort the list by US capital using a binary sort. Once the 2D array is sorted the user will be prompted to name as many capitals as they can and input quit to terminate and move on to the next command. The program will then print out the total correct inputs. After this we will create a hashmap of the states and then sort it the hashmap using a binary tree.

## Goals & Non-Goals
demonstrate fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms

## Who Is This For? 
This was a personal hobby project

## Why Should You Care About It? 
Just another personal project, you don't really have to care about it.


## What's Next? 
Still working on that part.
